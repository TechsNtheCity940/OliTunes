Notes:

    Data Format: Uses TabCNN predictions (y_pred) and ground truth (y_val) to assess prediction reliability.
    Synthetic Data: Generates random spectrograms and corresponding tabs, with noisy TabCNN predictions.
    Real Data: Replace with your validation set (e.g., spectrograms and fret annotations).
    Calibration: Adjusts thresholds to achieve ~80% accuracy, as per your ConfidenceEvaluator logic.
    Output: Saves results to a JSON file for later use or inspection.

Additional Considerations
Dataset Preparation

For both scripts, you’ll need a dataset with:

    Spectrograms: For TabCNN input (already covered in the previous training script).
    Tablature Sequences: For LSTMPredictor (raw predictions from TabCNN and ground truth).
    Validation Set: For ConfidenceEvaluator (spectrograms, TabCNN predictions, and ground truth).

If using GuitarSet:

    Preprocess audio to spectrograms (librosa.feature.melspectrogram).
    Convert MIDI or tab annotations to one-hot encoded fret positions (6 strings x 21 frets).
    Run TabCNN on spectrograms to get raw predictions for LSTMPredictor.

Integration with UnifiedTabProcessor

After training:

    Update UnifiedTabProcessor.__init__ to load the trained weights:
    python

    self.lstm = LSTMPredictor()
    self.lstm.model.load_weights('lstm_final.h5') if os.path.exists('lstm_final.h5') else None
    Use calibrated thresholds from confidence_calibration.json if desired, though ConfidenceEvaluator updates itself during calibration.

Non-Trainable Components

    DemucsProcessor: Pre-trained; no training needed unless you’re fine-tuning it.
    EnhancedAudioAnalyzer: Rule-based fretboard mapping; no training required.
    MidiConverter, MusicTheoryAnalyzer, TabTextGenerator: Algorithmic, not ML-based.

   Audio Pairing: If you have audio for these songs, TabCNN can generate real predictions instead of synthetic noisy data.
    Tuning Detection: Parse tuning (e.g., "Drop C") and adjust string MIDI values in EnhancedAudioAnalyzer.
    Timing: Refine time_step based on tempo metadata if available in the tab.

2. Preparing the GuitarSet Dataset

GuitarSet provides audio (WAV) and annotations (JAMS files) for solo guitar performances. We need to convert it into:

    Spectrograms: For TabCNN input (X_train).
    Tablature Sequences: For LSTMPredictor ground truth (y_train).

Preprocessing Script

Steps to Use GuitarSet

    Download GuitarSet: Get it from Zenodo or your local copy.
    Install Dependencies: Ensure jams is installed (pip install jams).
    Run Preprocessing: Update guitarset_dir and execute the script.
    Train Models:
        TabCNN: Use X_spec_train.npy and y_lstm_train.npy (reshape as needed).
        LSTMPredictor: Use X_lstm_train.npy and y_lstm_train.npy.

Output Format

    X_spec_train.npy: (samples, timesteps, 128) - Spectrograms for TabCNN.
    X_lstm_train.npy: (samples, timesteps, 126) - TabCNN predictions for LSTMPredictor.
    y_lstm_train.npy: (samples, timesteps, 126) - Ground-truth tab sequences.

Combining UG and GuitarSet

    UG Tabs: Use process_ug_tabs to generate X_lstm_train and y_lstm_train. Pair with audio if available, or simulate noisy predictions.
    GuitarSet: Use process_guitarset for a fully paired dataset (audio + annotations).
    Merge: Concatenate the arrays:
    python

    X_lstm = np.concatenate((X_lstm_guitarset, X_lstm_ug), axis=0)
    y_lstm = np.concatenate((y_lstm_guitarset, y_lstm_ug), axis=0)

Then train the LSTM as before.
Next Steps

    Run UG Extraction: Start downloading tabs for artists/genres you’re targeting.
    Validate Parsing: Check a few parsed UG tabs to ensure accuracy (e.g., print note_events).
    Process GuitarSet: Run the preprocessing and verify output shapes.
    Train & Test: Use the combined dataset to train the LSTM and evaluate improvements.
